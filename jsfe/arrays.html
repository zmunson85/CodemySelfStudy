1,2,3,4,5

//to access the interiror array you need to add an aditional set of brackets in the document.write or console.log or print statement.
to test it the next statement will be document.write(pizzaToppings[5]) that will get the array inside the array, 
now if I want to access the interior array that will look like document.write(pizzaToppings[5][1])
// the script
<script>

            //each arr has an index this arra has 5 indecies but it starts with the zero index and goes up as shown in the next comment.

        document.write(pizzaToppings[5][1]);
    </script>

    // the output

    Arrays!!
    2

    notice we called the first index in the interior array it returnded 2 which is correct,

    declare a new variable firstName, it will become the 5 index we can access it by calling that index.

    <script>
                    firstName = "Zach"
                //each arr has an index this arra has 5 indecies but it starts with the zero index and goes up as shown in the next comment.
                                        //     0index         1index        2index       3index      4index
            var pizzaToppings = ["Pepperoni", "Mushroom", "Sausage", "Cheese", "Green Onion", firstName ]
        
            document.write(pizzaToppings[5]);
        </script>

        //use numbers inside an interior array that has 4 indecies of its own.

        <script>
                        var nums= [1,2,3,4,5]
                    //each arr has an index this arra has 5 indecies but it starts with the zero index and goes up as shown in the next comment.
                                            //     0index         1index        2index       3index      4index
                var pizzaToppings = ["Pepperoni", "Mushroom", "Sausage", "Cheese", "Green Onion", [1,2,3,4,5] ]
            
                document.write(pizzaToppings[5][1]);
            </script>

            // output on screen is 
            Arrays!!
            2
            which is correct, if you look at the given array, the last indes is another array, I called for index 1 which is the value of 2.

            // output to find the end of the interior array

                <script>
                                var nums= [1,2,3,4,5]

                        var pizzaToppings = ["Pepperoni", "Mushroom", "Sausage", "Cheese", "Green Onion", [1,2,3,4,5] ]
                    
                        document.write(pizzaToppings[pizzaToppings.length - 1]);
                    </script>

                    // fun way to print last item in an array, i set variable to be first name  here, 

                    <script>
                                    firstName= "Zach"
                                //each arr has an index this arra has 5 indecies but it starts with the zero index and goes up as shown in the next comment.
                                                        //     0index         1index        2index       3index      4index

                            document.write(pizzaToppings[pizzaToppings.length - 1]);
